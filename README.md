This spell was forked from meta-loop and its a wrapper around loop cli.

>This and others meta plugins were forked due the limiation that commander has in order to call subcommands, they need to be name wiht the same prefix as the parent command cli. the current meta implemention has some limitations for some plugins where they cannot be installed independenly and need to be embeded inside the meta master cli.
